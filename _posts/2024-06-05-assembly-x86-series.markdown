I am currently working on a series of posts about assembly programming.
For this occasion, I created the **series** section in the blog 📑 : a place dedicated to articles that intend to deeply explore 🔎 some specific topics with advanced explanations and hands-on examples.

In my first series, I will explore assembly programming : programming with the language of processors' instruction sets 🧑‍💻.
x86 being the most common processor architecture on desktop and laptop computers 💻, I will solely focus on that specific platform.
The idea is to progress step by step toward the goal of being able to implement practical programs without the use of a higher level langue.

My interest in assembly programming and more generally low level programming comes from the observation that modern softwares have a very intensive use of resources for many avoidable tasks ⚡.
The idea is to understand more deeply how softwares work and being able to apprehend unreasonable use of computing resources.
I am also concerned by planned obsolescence that could come from softwares becoming unusable after system upgrade for instance.
For this reason, I am also interested in the idea of retro-compatibility and the possibility to patch softwares without any source code by reading its assembly instructions 💾.
For instance, see this [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOOx4mmY6I) about patching an old game to make it work on modern operating systems.

This series will be written as I learn on the topic, with potential mistakes made along the way 🤐.
I spend some time writing about it to compile knowledge that can be sometimes difficult to find on the net, and also to rise some interest in this approach.
The series would be more adapted to someone already familiar with programming, preferably with a low level language like C.

The first few posts of this series are available at this [link](/series/x86_64_assembly/headline). Enjoy !
