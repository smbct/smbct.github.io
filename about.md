## About

Welcome to my blog. I have been in the research / computing industry for few years now. I have a background in computer science and some experience in its interface with biology and I hope to use this blog as a place to keep notes and discuss various topics.


My current interests gravitate around science, computing technologies and their current use in society.
I am also mainly concerned about the climate crisis as well as social and international inequalities.
Technology is currently being used in a very non-fair way and is distracting us from the real problems.
