Sometimes I start working on one post and as I write the content, I realize that more content would be interesting to better understand and further explore the topic.
That is how series are created, a place where I would add details and technical content.

<h2 class="series">x86-64 assembly programming
<a class="series" href='/series/x86_64_assembly/headline'>
test
</a>
</h2>


<div class="series" href='/series/x86_64_assembly/headline' onclick="location.href='/series/x86_64_assembly/headline';">
<center>
<h2>x86-64 assembly programming</h2>
</center>
<p>
A series that covers the basics of x86-64 programming.
</p>
</div>


<div class="series" onclick="location.href='/series/reverse_engineering/headline';">
<center>
<h2>Reverse engineering</h2>
</center>
<p>
